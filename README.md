# Font Pairing

When it comes to picking fonts for your designs, there are a lot of things to consider. But one of the most important things to think about is font pairing. Font pairing is the process of choosing two or more fonts that work well together.

There are a few things to keep in mind when font pairing. First, you want to make sure that the fonts you choose have enough contrast. You don’t want two fonts that are too similar, as this can make your design look messy. Second, you want to make sure the fonts you choose complement each other. You don’t want two fonts that compete with each other for attention.

If you keep these things in mind, you’ll be well on your way to finding the perfect font pairing for your next project.
